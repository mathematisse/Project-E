# Introduction

> **Warning:** The engine is still in its early stages of development, and many features are still being worked on.

If you came here is because you are curious about the engine, right? So let's start with the basics.

## What is Project-E?

Project-E aims to:

- Provide a simple and easy-to-use API for development
- Facilitate the creation of games by providing a set of pre-made modules
- Fast enough to run games with a decent amount of entities
- Be cross-platform (Windows, Linux)
- Data Focused

Project-E is a game engine written in C++ for educational purposes during the R-Type project at EPITECH. It is designed to be modular, easy to use, and easy to understand. The engine is based on the Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, which allows for a high level of modularity and flexibility.
